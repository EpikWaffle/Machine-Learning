# Machine-Learning
A collection of works in classes I'm taking regarding machine learning

I am currently enrolled in a Statistical Learning class at Peking University. In that folder are my homeworks. A final project will be uploaded at the end of the semester when that is finished. 

I am also working through Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Coursera to help me with a more hands on and practical approach that involves a lot more application. In that folder are my solutions to the programming assignments for the course. It will be updated as I work through the weeks.
